# risky-bot

## This is my personal bot for discord.

This bot is running on a Google Cloud VM and currently connected to some of the servers that I manage. The code is open and you're free to use it for your own bot project.

#### The modules/libraries that are used in this project:
* Discord.py's rewrite branch (with voice support)
* Youtube-DL

#### Dependencies that need to be installed seperately:
* FFMpeg
* libopus (the compiled Windows .dll is already included with Discord.py, however Linux environments need to install libopus seperately)


Thanks to EvieePy (github.com/EvieePy) for their music.py script that offers a basic support for music for Rewrite.

Original code of music.py available at:

## This bot is a work-in-progress project.

I'm basically adding functionality has I see needed for myself. I'm also still learning python. Maybe I should have wrote something in Java or C# instead, but now it's too late and I'm enjoying learning Python.


**I will also update the readme with more relevant information of the project as time goes by**
